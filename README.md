Are you looking to create a DIY LED light project circuit? If so, you have come to the right place! LED light projects are becoming increasingly popular, and with a few simple steps you can be up and running in no time.

In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of creating an LED light project circuit, from understanding the components of the circuit to wiring it all together.

We'll also take a look at the different types of LED lights that you can use for your project. So let's get started and learn how to make an LED light project circuit!


Component List - 

To make this LED light project circuit, we might need some electronics component. Those component lists have to been given below.

Component List :

1. PCB – made by JLCPCB

2. Transistor - TIP 41c and BD 139

3. LED – 5mm

5. Resistor – 56 KΩ

6. Capacitor - 100uf/ 16v

7. Power Source – DC 12v


Specification of Transistor - 

The TIP41C is a base island technology NPN. power transistor in TO-220 plastic package that.To make this device suitable for audio, power linear. and switching applications.

•	Base Part Number: TIP41

•	Package Type: TO-220

•	Transistor Type: NPN

•	Max Collector Current(IC): 6A or 6000mA

•	Max Collector-Emitter Voltage (VCE): 100V

•	Max Collector-Base Voltage (VCB): 100V

•	Max Emitter-Base Voltage (VEBO): 5V

•	Max Collector Dissipation (Pc): 65W

•	Max Transition Frequency (fT): 3 MHz

•	Minimum & Maximum DC Current Gain (hFE): 15 - 75

•	Max Storage & Operating temperature Should Be: -65 to +150 Centigrade

•	New enhanced series

•	High switching speed

•	hFE grouping

•	hFE improved linearity



Connect TIP41 with BD139 - 

To make this circuit, 1st we connect one transistor with another transistor. We connect TIP41c transistor emitter leg with BD139 transistor emitter leg.

Make 12v LED Light - 

Since it is a 12v LED light project circuit, for that we need to use DC-12v led light. Though we are using 3v led light, for that we need to convert 3v led light to 12v led light.

We use 4 pieces 3v LED light to make a 12v LED light. We connect one LED positive leg with another LED negative leg. In this way we will leg a 12v LED light.

This way, we might make 2 pieces 12v LED light. Then we connect 2 pieces 12v LED light positive leg with each other.


Connect Resistor with Circuit - 

Now we need to connect resistor with the circuit. We connect resistor one side with each other. We got three terminal of this LED light. 

This time we connect resistor common side with LED positive leg and the rest two terminals with both transistor Base leg.



Connect Capacitor with Circuit - 

To make this circuit, we are using two pieces 100uf/ 16v capacitor. Now we connect capacitor with the circuit. Now we connect this two capacitor positive leg with both transistor Collector leg.

The capacitor positive leg connected with BD139 transistor, connect that capacitor negative leg with TIP41c transistor Base leg.
In the same way, the capacitor positive leg connected with TIP41c transistor, connect that capacitor negative leg with BD139 transistor Base leg.


Soldering and Cleaning - 
Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection.

After soldering all legs, we cut-off the extra legs of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Connect Power Supply - 

For power supply, we are using DC 12v. You can use 12v battery or can use the power supply that can provide DC 12v, then led light will blown away and the circuit may damage also.

Connect DC-12v positive cable with LED positive leg and connect DC-12v negative cable with emitter leg of transistor.
